# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem
Your Next.js Taboo game is showing the default Next.js landing page instead of your custom game UI on Vercel.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### 1. **Clear Vercel Cache**
```bash
# In your Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to your project settings
# 2. Find "Build & Development Settings"
# 3. Click "Clear Build Cache"
# 4. Redeploy your project
```

### 2. **Force Redeploy**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments tab
# 2. Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment
# 3. Or make a small change and push to trigger auto-deploy
```

### 3. **Verify File Structure**
Your project should have this structure:
```
tabu-app/
├── app/                    # ✅ App Router (Next.js 13+)
│   ├── page.tsx           # ✅ Main page component
│   ├── components/        # ✅ Game components
│   ├── contexts/          # ✅ Game context
│   └── types/            # ✅ TypeScript types
├── words.json             # ✅ Game data
├── package.json           # ✅ Dependencies
└── next.config.ts         # ✅ Next.js config
```

### 4. **Check for Conflicting Directories**
- ❌ **Remove** `pages/` directory if it exists
- ✅ **Keep** only `app/` directory (App Router)

### 5. **Verify Build Output**
After building locally, you should see:
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# Route (app) Size First Load JS
# ┌ ○ / 22.2 kB 124 kB
```

### 6. **Check Vercel Build Logs**
In Vercel dashboard, check:
- Build logs for any errors
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Node.js version is compatible (18+ recommended)

### 7. **Force Refresh Browser**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private mode

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Open browser dev tools and look for:
```
GameApp render: { isGameActive: false, currentRound: 1, totalRounds: 3 }
```

### 2. **Verify Component Loading**
You should see:
- 🎯 Tabu Oyunu title banner
- Team setup form
- Game configuration options

### 3. **Check Network Tab**
Ensure all components are loading without 404 errors.

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
